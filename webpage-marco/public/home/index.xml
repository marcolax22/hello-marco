      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Marco Lax and I am a Data Scientist and studied Social Data Science at the university of Copenhagen. I am a data-driven and detail-oriented person with a background in Data Science and a strong focus on data management and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am active at CorrelAid, an association that empowers non-profits to utilise data in a critical and reflective manner to achieve their objectives, while also enabling effective engagement of volunteers in Data4Good. From 2021 to 2024, I served on the CorrelAid board, contributing to the development and growth of the organization. During this time, we expanded our community to over 2,400 volunteers and built a team of 13 employees. As of 2025, I have taken on a new role within CorrelAid&amp;rsquo;s Statutory Committee, continuing to support the organizationâ€™s mission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
