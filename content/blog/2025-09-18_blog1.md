Looking at the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

To get started I tried it out with an API of interest and wanted to connect it to the Claude AI.

Therefore intialising a project with uv:

```bash
    # Create a new directory for our project
    uv init mcp-test
    cd mcp-test

    # Create virtual environment and activate it
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx

    # Create our server file
    touch mcp.py
```
