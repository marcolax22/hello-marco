title = "Model Context Protocol and building an MCP server"

+++

Looking at the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

To get started I tried it out with an API of interest and wanted to connect it to the Claude AI. I will write the MCP in Python, but there is also the possibility to write it in JS, C# or other languages. Before we start we will use ``uv`` to intintialise the project. ``uv`` is a single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more. If you have not looked into it, definitly [check it out](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Therefore intialising a project with ``uv``in your terminal (my code is written for macOS/Linux):

```bash
    # Create a new directory for our project
    uv init mcp-test
    cd mcp-test

    # Create virtual environment and activate it
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx

    # Create our server file
    touch mcp.py
```
